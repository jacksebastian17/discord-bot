# discord-bot
-This is just a simple Discord bot that I programmed myself so that me and my friends can use while we're on discord. 

-It's a pretty standard bot with not a ton of commands, but I'm going to keep adding onto it so that the bot will provide more useful features.

-This was purely my initiative to work on this project. It wasn't an assignment from one of my Computer Science classes or anything like that, this was something I wanted to do on my own.
